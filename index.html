      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a 2D maze game developed using raycasting as part of my
        portfolio project at Holberton School. The main objective of the game is
        to navigate through the maze and find the exit. The game is built using
        SDL2 and C, focusing on smooth player movement and maze exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player controls the character using the WASD keys to move through
        the maze, while the ESC key allows the player to exit the game.
        Currently, the game does not include advanced features like lighting
        effects, enemies, or weather effects. The emphasis is on creating a
        functional, engaging maze experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though features like more complex textures, enemies, and a menu are
        planned for future updates, the current version showcases the essential
        gameplay of navigating through the maze to find the exit.
